here is link for day-planner.

instead of constricting it from 9-5, I decided to make it a 24-hour planner as an example for those that might have night shifts.

you would type in task at hand & save it with the green save button located on the right of time slot to keep track of what needs to be completed/will do/have finished.

not sure if any other functions need to be present here.

any questions/concerns feel free to lemme know.
